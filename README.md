## 🚀 Running Locally

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Start development server (defaults to port 3000, or customize with PORT=...)
npm run dev

# 4. Or build and run production server
npm run build
npm run start
# For port 80: npm run start:prod
```

## 🚀 One-Click Production Deployment to Another Server (`setup.sh`)

To deploy and run this project on a brand new Ubuntu/Debian Linux server with all dependencies, database data, and background systemd service:

```bash
# 1. Clone repository to the destination server
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL> /root/hr
cd /root/hr

# 2. Make setup script executable
chmod +x setup.sh

# 3. Run automated setup (installs Node.js, native build tools, compiles Next.js, applies DB data, and starts systemd service on port 80)
sudo ./setup.sh
```

### Useful `setup.sh` Options

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `sudo ./setup.sh` | Full automated install & deployment (Port 80) |
| `sudo ./setup.sh --port 3000` | Deploy service on custom port (e.g., 3000) |
| `sudo ./setup.sh --apply-db` | Force apply database data from `data/init_data.sql` (creates safety backup) |
| `sudo ./setup.sh --db-only` | Only apply/restore the database data without touching services |
| `sudo ./setup.sh --service-only`| Only regenerate and restart the `hr.service` systemd service |
| `sudo ./setup.sh --skip-build` | Deploy without re-running `npm run build` |

### Database Management Commands

```bash
# Export latest database tables and data to data/init_data.sql
npm run db:dump

# Restore or apply data/init_data.sql into data/hr.db
npm run db:apply
```

### Managing the Background Service

```bash
# Check service health
systemctl status hr.service

# View live application logs
journalctl -u hr.service -f

# Restart service
systemctl restart hr.service
```
